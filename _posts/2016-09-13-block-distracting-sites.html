excerpt: Ever got into a situation where you got stuck on a task or got side-tracked, then the next thing you know you were spending 2+ hours reading your feed on Facebook or Twitter? We've all been there. However, distractions are quite expensive. In fact, studies show people spend 23 minutes to refocus once they're distracted. If you procrastinate at least once a day, that's 11.5 hours wasted!

<p>Ever got into a situation where you got stuck on a task or got side-tracked, then the next thing you know you were spending 2+ hours reading your feed on Facebook or Twitter? We've all been there. However, distractions are quite expensive. In fact, studies show people spend 23 minutes to refocus once they're distracted. If you procrastinate at least once a day, that's 11.5 hours wasted!</p>

<p>I'm excited to announce our new feature for Dayboard's Chrome extension, <em>Site Blocking</em>. Block any site that you find distracting. If you end up on a distracting site, we'll block the site and remind you about what you should be working on instead.</p>

<h3>Why should I use it?</h3>
<p> Blocking distracting sites until your tasks are completed will help you stay focused and make the most of your time, so you can accomplish more during your day. I can't emphasize enough how expensive distractions are to your time, especially when you're trying to make progress to important things in life.</p>

<h3>How do I use it?</h3>
<p>1. By default with the release of this feature, we've blocked a few commonly distracting websites for you (i.e. Facebook, Twitter, and Reddit). You can add or remove any of these sites via your Dayboard extension settings.</p>
<small><em>Note: Only Dayboard Pro and Business users will have their next task show up on blocked sites.</em></small>

<p>2. Try visiting a distracting site. (a.k.a a site that's listed in your settings)</p>
<p>3. Tada! The site's been blocked and you can no longer visit it while you have tasks that are still listed on your to do list.</p>

<small><em>Note: Once your task list is empty, the sites are automatically unblocked the next time you visit.</em></small>

<h3>Extra Stuff </h3>
<p>Now, of course, we're not going to dictate how you should work. We simply want to help you eliminate distractions when it comes fit and help you reduce the time you spend to refocus.</p>

<p>If you're a Dayboard Pro or Business user, here's a couple of options you can choose when the site you're visiting are blocked:</p>

<ul>
  <li><b>'I'm done for the day' button</b> is an alternative to emptying your task list. We give you the option to unblock all distracting sites for the day. The feature will reset at 5am the next day so you can start off your work day right, without distractions. Just be sure that's what you want, since there's no undo at the moment.</li>
  <small><em>Note: This is especially helpful if you use Dayboard while working and need to turn off the site blocking once your work day is over.</em></small>

  <li><b>'Go back to my task' button</b>. Make use of another new feature of ours: <a href="blog.dayboard.co/add-links-to-tasks">reference links.</a>If you've added a reference link for your current task, it will take you to that link. Otherwise, it defaults to your Dayboard tasks page.</li>
</ul>
