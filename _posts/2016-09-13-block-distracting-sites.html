<h3>What is it?</h3>
<p>A feature that'll let you block any site that you find distracting. If you end up on a distracting site, we'll block that site and remind you about what you should be working on instead.</p>

<h3>Why do I need it?</h3>
<p> Blocking distracting sites until your tasks are completed, will help you stay focused and make the most of your time so you can accomplish more during your day.</p>

<h3>How do I use it?</h3>
<p>1. By default with the release of this feature, we've blocked a few commonly distracting websites for you. You can add to, or remove any of these sites via your chrome extension settings.</p>

<p>2. Try visiting a distracting site. (a.k.a a site that's listed in your settings)</p>
<p>3. Tada! The site's been blocked and you can no longer visit it while you have tasks that are still listed on your to do list.</p>

<p>Note: Once your task list is empty, the sites are automatically unblocked the next time you visit.</p>

<h3>Extra Stuff </h3>
<p>
  <li><b>'I'm done for the day' button: </b>Is an alternative to emptying your task list. We give you the option to unblock all distracting sites for the day. The feature will reset at 5am the next day so you can start off your work day right, without distractions.</li>
  <small><em>Note: This is especially helpful if you use Dayboard while working and need to turn off the site blocking once your work day is over.</em></small>
</p>
<p>
  <li><b>'Get outta here' button: </b>Makes use of another new feature of ours: <a href="blog.dayboard.co/add-links-to-tasks">reference links. </a>If you've added a reference link for your current task, it will take you to that link. Otherwise, it defaults to your dayboard tasks page.</li>
</p>
