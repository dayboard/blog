excerpt: Ever got into a situation where you got stuck on a task or got side-tracked, then the next thing you know you were spending 2+ hours reading your feed on Facebook or Twitter? We've all been there. However, distractions are quite expensive. In fact, studies show people spend 23 minutes to refocus once they're distracted. If you procrastinate at least once a day, that's 11.5 hours wasted in a month!

<p>Ever got into a situation where you got stuck on a task or got side-tracked? The next thing you know, you've spent 2+ hours reading your feed on Facebook or Twitter. We've all been there. However, distractions are quite expensive. In fact, studies show people spend 23 minutes to refocus once they're distracted. If you procrastinate at least once a day, that's 11.5 hours wasted in a month!</p>

<p>I'm excited to announce our new feature for Dayboard's Chrome extension, <em>Site Blockers</em>. It blocks any site that you find distracting and will remind you about what you should be working on instead. If you use site blockers with our latest feature <a href="/add-links-to-tasks">reference links</a>, it takes a step further and links you to your task.</p>

<small><em>Please note: Website blocking is available to all users, but only Dayboard Pro and Business users will have their next task show up on blocked sites, as well as the ability to escape to the task dashboard or the link to the task.</em></small>

<h3>Why should I use it?</h3>
<p>Website blockers today <em>only</em> help you block a site, but won't tell you what to do next. We thought there's a missed opportunity here to really help people refocus, stay effective and be productive, so we went on to build this feature so that you'll be able to see your task at hand. And because we really do want to help you, I can say we're the first to include your task on the screen of the blocked website.</p>

<p>And as I've mentioned above, all users will have website blocking but the inclusion of your task is a premium feature.</p>

<h3>How do I use it?</h3>
<p>1. Go to your <em>Extension Settings</em>.</p>

<p>2. Add or remove any distracting website via your Dayboard extension settings.</p>
<small><em>Please note: If you don't have any tasks in your Dayboard, site blocking won't work. Make sure you have some tasks added into your Dayboard if you wish to try this feature out.</em></small>

<p>3. Now try visiting a distracting site that was listed in your settings. You should be able to see the website being blocked.</p>
<p>4. If you're finished with your day and would like to resume browsing on the websites you've listed in your settings, just simply click on <strong>I'm done for the day</strong> to unblock the websites. Just make sure that's what you want to do since it can't be undone at the moment and site blocking will not resume until 5am the next day.</p>

<small><em>Note: Once your task list is empty, the sites are automatically unblocked the next time you visit.</em></small>

<h3>Extra Stuff </h3>
<p>Now, of course, we're not going to dictate how you should work. We simply want to help you eliminate distractions when it comes fit and help you reduce the time you spend to refocus.</p>

<p>If you're a Dayboard Pro or Business user, here's a couple of options you can choose when the site you're visiting are blocked:</p>

<ul>
  <li><b>'Go back to my task' button</b>. Make use of another new feature of ours: <a href="/add-links-to-tasks">reference links.</a>If you've added a reference link for your current task, it will take you to that link. Otherwise, it defaults to your Dayboard tasks page.</li>
</ul>

<hr/>
<p>That's it for Blocked Sites. Pretty straight forward, right? Give it a try and let us know what you think. If you have any questions about blocking sites or using Dayboard in general, feel free to email us at <a href="mailto:support@dayboard.co">support@dayboard.co</a>. We're more than happy to help. :)</p>
