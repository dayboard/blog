excerpt: We've got a new feature - Site Blocker! If you end up on a distracting site, we'll block it and help you get refocused instead.
---
<p><strong>Distractions are expensive&mdash;it takes, on average, 23 minutes to refocus from a distraction.</strong> If you procrastinate once a day for a month, that's roughly 11.5 hours wasted! I don't know about you, but I certainly get distracted more than once a day and I'd rather not lose anymore of my time if I can help it.
</p>

<h3>Introducing Site Blocker</h3>
<p>This is why I'm excited to announce Dayboard's new Chrome extension feature, Site Blocker. It'll help you limit distractions online while you still have work to accomplish. Here's what it looks like as it blocks our friend Max on Twitter: </p>

<h3>How does it help me?</h3>
<p>Website blocker today only help you block sites, which on its' own isn't very encouraging. We thought this was a great opportunity to really help people refocus, and be productive so we've made things more interesting and interactive.</p>

<p>Dayboard's Site Blocker will stop you from wasting time. <strong>If you end up on a distracting site, we'll block it and help you get refocused on your work instead.</strong> Read the 'Differences on Dayboard Pro and Dayboard Basic' section below, for more detail.</p>

<h3>How do I use it?</h3>
<p>1. <a href="https://chrome.google.com/webstore/detail/dayboard-new-tab-site-blo/kimodcegbhclamjcbifgfaldeengbgij?hl=en">Download</a> Dayboard's Chrome extension and add a task you'd like to complete.</p>
<p>2. Go to your extension settings.</p>

<p>3. Add or remove any distracting websites via your Dayboard extension settings. By default, everyone is blocked from Facebook, Twitter, and Reddit.</p>

<p>4. Now try visiting a distracting site that was listed in your settings. You should see that the website is blocked.</p>
<p>5. Complete all the tasks on your Dayboard or click "I'm done for the day" to unblock the sites and start browsing, guilt free.</p>

<h3>Site Blocker on Dayboard Pro and Dayboard Basic</h3>
<p>Site Blocker is available to all Dayboard users but there are some important differences between our Pro and Basic versions.</p>

<h4><strong>The blocked site on Dayboard Pro:</strong></h4>
<ul>
  <li>Displays your current task, and help you remember exactly what you should be working on.</li>
  <li>Links you to either your Dayboard task list or your <a href="/add-links-to-tasks">task reference</a>, if you've listed one.</li>
  <li>Will stop blocking sites until 5am the next day, if you decide that you're 'done for the day' but still have tasks on your dashboard.</li>
</ul>
