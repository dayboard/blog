excerpt: We've got a new feature - Site Blocking! If you end up on a distracting site, we'll block it and help you get refocused instead.
---
<h4>Did you know?</h4>
<p>Studies show that people spend, on average, 23 minutes to refocus once they're distracted. If you procrastinate once a day, that's roughly 11.5 hours a month wasted! I don't know about you, but I certainly get distracted more than once a day and I'd rather not lose anymore of my time if I can help it.
</p>

<p>This is why I'm excited to announce Dayboard's new Chrome extension feature, <strong>Site Blockers</strong>.</p>

<h3>How does it help me?</h3>
<p>Site Blockers will stop you from wasting time. If you end up on a distracting site, we'll block it and help you get refocused on your work instead.</p>

<p>Website blockers today <em>only</em> help you block sites, which on its' own isn't very encouraging. We thought this was a great opportunity to really help people refocus, and be productive so we've made things more interesting and interactive. Read the Pro vs Basic section below, for more detail.</p>

<h3>How do I use it?</h3>
<p>1. Download Dayboard's Chrome extension and add a task you'd like to complete.</p>
<p>2. Go to your <em>Extension Settings</em>.</p>

<p>3. Add or remove any distracting website via your Dayboard extension settings. By default, everyone is blocked from Facebook, Twitter, and Reddit.</p>

<p>4. Now try visiting a distracting site that was listed in your settings. You should be able to see the website being blocked.</p>
<p>5. Complete all the tasks on your Dayboard or click "I'm done for the day" to unblock the sites and start browsing, guilt free.</p>

<h3>Pro vs Basic</h3>

<!-- If you use site blockers with our latest feature <a href="/add-links-to-tasks">reference links</a>, it takes a step further and links you to your task.</p>

<small><em>Please note: Website blocking is available to all users, but only Dayboard Pro and Business users will have their next task show up on blocked sites, as well as the ability to escape to the task dashboard or the link to the task.</em></small>
 -->

<p>For those that are using Dayboard Basic (which is free) or just using our Chrome extension by itself, you'll see something like the screenshot below when site blocking is enabled. By default, everyone is blocked on Facebook, Twitter, and Reddit. You can edit your preference in the extension settings.</p> -->
