We've released a few upgrades to our [Site Blocker](https://blog.dayboard.co/website-blocker-chrome): site blockers can now be scheduled, an extension icon that quickly shows you if the site blocker is active, and a shortcut to helps you add distracting sites to your blocked list.

Before today, unless site blocking was turned off completely, the only way to turn it off was to either complete all of your tasks or click on the 'I'm done working for the day' button. Now, you can have more control over the site blocker by scheduling *when* it should be active.

### How to Schedule Your Site Blockers

1\. Go to your Dayboard extension settings and click on the 'Blocked Sites' tab.

</div>

2\. Choose which days of the week you'd like the Site Blocker to be active. By default, site blocking is turned off on Saturday and Sunday.

</div>

3\. Choose how much time per day you'd like to set aside for breaks. The default is set to 10 minutes a day, but you can set it for up to 60 minutes.

4\. These settings can be changed at any time, but will only take effect at midnight.

### Dayboard Extension Icon

We've also rolled out a new upgrade: the Dayboard extension icon. This icon will change colours depending on if you're on a distracting site or not. Clicking on the icon will expand to give you more information about the site blocker and a few quick shortcuts.

**Here's how it works**:

*If the icon is green*, the website is not currently on your blocked list. Clicking on the browser icon will reveal a shortcut to add the current page as a distracting site, or how much time you have left for browsing a distracting site.

</div>

Or, if you do not have any tasks listed on your Dayboard, clicking on the icon will reveal a shortcut to add tasks to activate the site blocker.

<div>
  <img src="/assets/images/product/site-blocker-no-task-notification.png" title="Dayboard's site blocker are only active when you have a task set in Dayboard." alt="Dayboard Site Blocker Extension Icon - Green">
</div>

*If the icon is red*, the website is on your blocked list. Clicking the browser icon will display how much time you have left to take breaks from your work. When there's no time left, all of the distracting sites on your blocked list will be blocked for the rest of the day.

<div>
