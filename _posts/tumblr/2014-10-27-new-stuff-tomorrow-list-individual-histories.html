<p>It&rsquo;s been very busy for Dayboard last month and today, we&rsquo;re announcing a few new features based on the feedback that you&rsquo;ve given us. </p>
<h3>Tomorrow list</h3>
<p><span>Done for the day, and want to plan for tomorrow? Now you can plan ahead and write down tomorrow&rsquo;s tasks in Dayboard.</span></p>
<p>Here&rsquo;s how it works:</p>

<h3>14-Day History</h3>
<p class="pl_editable_block"><span>You can now view the individual history of each member in your team. It shows all the tasks they&rsquo;ve completed and a 14 days history graph of their recent productivity. </span></p>

<h3>More improvements to come!</h3>
