<p>It's no secret, not everything on our to-do lists are worth doing. Spend a day doing busywork and you'll end your day feeling guilty and unproductive, but get one important task done and you'll be making progress.</p>

<h3>Real progress comes from our most important tasks</h3>
<p><a href="https://dayboard.co/?source=blog">Dayboard</a> is a daily task management app that helps you complete your most important tasks each day. Unlike other to-do lists, Dayboard limits users to just five tasks per day.</p>
<p>Every time you open a new tab, Dayboard's <a href="https://chrome.google.com/webstore/detail/dayboard-new-tab-page/kimodcegbhclamjcbifgfaldeengbgij?hl=en/?source=blog" target="_blank">browser extension</a> (currently only available to Chrome users) gently remind you of the task at hand. We think this will help you stay focused, prevents you from feeling overwhelmed, and helps fight distractions like Twitter and Facebook &ndash; allowing you to focus on the work that truly matters.</p>

<h3>Dayboard also works great for teams</h3>
<p>By capturing everyone's daily priorities, teams gain visibility of what's happening in a company in ways most project management and task management apps can't.</p>
<p>For example, most project management apps are great for giving a bird's eye view of the companies' general priorities, but fail to capture individual day-to-day tasks. So instead, companies often rely on stand-up meetings &mdash; a practice that might not make sense for large teams or teams collaborating across different time zones.</p>

<p>Dayboard has already helped many people feel great about their work. We have over 7500 users downloading the browser extension.</p>
