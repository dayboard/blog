<p>Have you ever felt demotivated when tasks on your to do list become stale over time? Or that you’re not sure what to do when they are stale?</p>
<p>Now, you can see when stale tasks need your attention on Dayboard. We want to help you overcome these issues as soon as they come up.</p>
<p>The notifications are shown whenever you have tasks more than four days old, followed by a warning sign. However, if you are <a href="http://dayboard.co" target="_blank">using Dayboard in a team</a>, and you’ve got blockers mentioning you by your teammates, that would come up first before this one.</p>
<p>This doesn’t mean you shouldn’t pay attention to them, but you might want to help out your teammates first, or at least let them know you’ll get to them soon.</p>
