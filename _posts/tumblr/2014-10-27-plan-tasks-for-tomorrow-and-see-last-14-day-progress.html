<p>It&rsquo;s been very busy for Dayboard last month and today, we&rsquo;re announcing a few new features based on the feedback that you&rsquo;ve given us. </p>
<h3>Tomorrow List</h3>
<p>Done for the day, and want to plan for tomorrow? Now you can plan ahead and write down tomorrow&rsquo;s tasks in Dayboard. However, you'll notice if you already have five tasks on your today list, you won't be able to add tasks on the tomorrow list. To add tasks for tomorrow, you'll need to complete some tasks for today. This is meant so that you're focused on the priorities in front of you versus getting busy planning too far ahead.</p>
<p>Here&rsquo;s a quick video of how it works:</p>

<h3>14-Day History</h3>
<p class="pl_editable_block">Whether you're using Dayboard by yourself or with a team, you can now see a 14-day history of your progress along with a neat bar graph showing you how productive were you in the last two weeks. For teams, you can now see the individual history of each team member.</p>
