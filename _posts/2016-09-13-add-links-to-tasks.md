I hope you love product enhancements as much as we do because we've got a nifty update for you.

You can now add reference links to a specific task and have easy access to the resources you need to accomplish your goals.

### How do I use it?

- Simply look for the link icon in next to your Dayboard task, beside the edit and delete icons.

- Click and type in a link to specific task details, github repositories, calendar reminders, etc.

- Hit enter when you're done, and you're ready to be more productive, just like that.

Check out the image below to see what I mean.

Ps. Your links will also be saved in history once the task has been completed, so you can go back and access the details at a later date if needed. :)
