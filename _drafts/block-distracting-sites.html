<h3>What is it?</h3>
<p>A feature that'll let you block any site that you find distracting. If you end up on a distracting site, we're going to be just a tad obnoxious (with your permission ;)) and remind you about what you should be working on instead.</p>

<h3>How do I use it?</h3>
<ol>
  <li>By default with the release of this feature, we've blocked a few commonly distracting websites for you. You can add to, or remove any of these sites via your chrome extension settings.</li>

  <img src="/assets/images/product/extension-setting.png" alt="Extension Setting" />

  <li>Try visiting a distracting site. (a.k.a a site that's listed in your setting)</li>
  <li>Tada! The site's been blocked and you can no longer visit it while you have tasks that are still listed on your to do list.</li>
  <img src="#"/> <!-- image of blocked site? -->

  <li>Once your task list is empty, the sites are automatically unblocked the next time you visit.</li>
</ol>
<h5>Extras: </h5>
<ul>
  <li><b>'I'm done for the day' button: </b>Is an alternative to emptying your task list. We give you the option to unblock all distracting sites for the day. The feature will reset at 5am the next day so you can start off your work day right, without distractions.</li>
  <em>Note: This is especially helpful if you use Dayboard while working and need to turn off the site blocking once your work day is over.</em>
  <li><b>'Get outta here' button: </b>Makes use of another new feature of ours: <a href="#reference to reference links">reference links. </a>If you've added a reference link for your current task, it will take you to that link. Otherwise, it defaults to your dayboard tasks page.</li> <!-- Note: this assumes that they're logged in.. i couldn't figure out how to make the default link chrome's task page. -->
</ul>

<h3>Why we created it?</h3>
<p>We're always trying to improve Dayboard and come out with new, valuable features for our users. As of right now, that means creating features that help minimize distractions and increase productivity. That's our goal for this feature; by being able to block distracting sites until your tasks are completed, we hope to help you accomplish more during your day.</p>
