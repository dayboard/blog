<p>Ever get trapped in the viscious clicking cycle of the internet? You say you're just going to read this one article, watch this one video, or talk to this one person and then BOOM! before you know it, it's been an hour and you have no idea where your time's gone.</p>
<p>Well, not anymore! We have the solution: <b>Dayboard's Refocus Tab.</b></p>

<h3>What is it?</h3>
<p>It's an annoyingly useful tool available to Dayboard's pro users that will remind you about what you should be working on when you find yourself on a site that you shouldn't be on.</p>

<h3>How do I use it? (There are only two steps!)</h3>
<ol>
  <li>List the site you find most distracting via Dayboard's Chrome Extension settings. Note: By default, we've got the Refocus tab displaying on every page that you visit. You can change this via the settings page as well. (See screenshot below)</li>

  <li>Refocus yourself the next time you find yourself on a distracting site.</li>
</ol>

<h3>Bonus:</h3>
<p>Because we know that at some point you'll want a break without any reminders of your task list, we've added a nifty little snooze feature right on the Refocus Tab.</p>

<p>You can snooze for 5mins, 30mins, 1 hour or 12 hours. Just hover over the x on the tab and click on one of the options. This way, you don't have to revisit your settings page everytime you want to take a break.</p>
