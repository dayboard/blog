We've upgraded our [Site Blocker](https://blog.dayboard.co/website-blocker-chrome). Before today, unless site blocking was turned off completely, the only way to turn it off was to either complete all of your tasks or click on the 'I'm done working for the day button'.

Now, you can have more control over the site blocker by scheduling when it's active.

### How do you customize the schedule?

1. Go to your Dayboard extension settings and click on the 'Blocked Sites' tab.

2. Choose what days of the week you'd like Dayboard's Site Blocker to help you block distracting websites. By default, site blocking is turned off on Saturday and Sunday.

3. Choose how much time per day you'd like to set aside for breaks. By default, we've set it to 10 minutes a day but if you'd like to change that, you can set it for up to 60 minutes a day.

### Some specifics to know

- These settings can be changed at anytime, but will only take effect at midnight.
- Next to your browser's search bar, Dayboard's extension icon will be set to two different colours depending on whether or not you've listed the site as distracting. Clicking on the icon will give you more information about what's going on.
   1. **Green**:
      - The website is not currently on your blocked list. Click on the browser icon to add it as a distracting site or to add tasks to your Dayboard.
      <!-- [NEW SCREEN SHOT NEEDED - link has change to button] -->
      - Or you do not have any tasks listed on your Dayboard. Click the icon to add tasks to your Dayboard.
      <!-- [ADD SCREEN SHOT] -->
   2. **Red**:
      - The website is on your blocked list. Click the browser icon to display how much time you have left on your break. When there's no time left, all of the distracting sites on your blocked list will be blocked for the rest of the day.
