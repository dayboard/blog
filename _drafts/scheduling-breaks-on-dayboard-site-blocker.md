excerpt: "You can now have more control over when you want site blocking to occur using our scheduling feature. Set active days, schedule break times, and quickly see how much distracting time you have left on any given moment."

We've upgraded our [Site Blocker](https://blog.dayboard.co/website-blocker-chrome). Before today, unless site blocking was turned off completely, the only way to turn it off was to either complete all of your tasks or click on the 'I'm done working for the day' button.

Now, you can have more control over the site blocker by scheduling *when* it should be active.

### How do you customize the schedule?

1\. Go to your Dayboard extension settings and click on the 'Blocked Sites' tab.

</div>

2\. Choose which days of the week you'd like the Site Blocker to be active. By default, site blocking is turned off on Saturday and Sunday.

</div>

3\. Choose how much time per day you'd like to set aside for breaks. The default is set to 10 minutes a day, but you can set it for up to 60 minutes.

### Some specifics to know

- These settings can be changed at any time, but will only take effect at midnight.
- Next to your browser's search bar, Dayboard's extension icon will change colours depending on if you're on a distracting site. Clicking on the icon will give you more information about what's going on.

  *If the icon is green*:

  - The website is not currently on your blocked list. Click on the browser icon to add it as a distracting site or to add tasks to your Dayboard.

  </div>

  - Or you do not have any tasks listed on your Dayboard. Click the icon to add tasks to your Dayboard.

  </div>

  *If the icon is red*:

  - The website is on your blocked list. Click the browser icon to display how much time you have left on your break. When there's no time left, all of the distracting sites on your blocked list will be blocked for the rest of the day.
