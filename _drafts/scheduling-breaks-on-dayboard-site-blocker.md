If you've been following our updates, you know that one of our latest features is a [site blocker](blog.dayboard.co/website-blocker-chrome) that allows you to block distracting sites while you use Dayboard. Before today, unless site blocking was turned off completely, the only way to turn it off was to either complete all your tasks or click on the 'I'm done working for the day button'.

Now, you can have more control over the site blocker, and schedule when it's active.

### How do you customize the schedule?

1. Go to your Dayboard extension settings and click on the 'Blocked Sites' tab.

2. Choose what days of the week you'd like Dayboard's Site Blocker to help you block distracting websites.

3. Choose how much time per day you'd like to set aside for breaks. By default, we've set it to 15 minutes per day and the maximum is 60 minutes per day.

### Some specifics to know

- These settings can be changed at anytime, but will only take effect at midnight.
- Next to your browser's search bar, where all your extensions live, Dayboard's extension icon will display two different color depending on if it's a website on your blocked list and how much distraction time you have left. By clicking on icon, it will give you more information about what's going on.
   1. **Green**: Not a website on your blocked list. There's also an option to easily add those sites if you deem them distracting.

   2. **Red**: It'll show distraction time left. When there's no time left, all distracting sites on your blocked list will be blocked for the rest of the day.
