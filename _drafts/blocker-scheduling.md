If you've been following our updates, you know that one of our latest features is a [site blocker](blog.dayboard.co/block-distracting-sites) that allows you to block distracting sites while you use Dayboard. Before today, unless site blocking was turned off completely, the only way to turn it off was to either complete all your tasks or click on the 'I'm done for the day button'.

Now, you can have more control over the site blocker, and schedule when it's active.

### How do you customize the schedule?

1. Go to your Dayboard extension settings and click on the 'Blocked Sites' tab.

2. Choose what days the site blocker is active.

[insert screen shot w/ blocked sites tab visible, arrow pointing to unchecked days; weekdays checked, and weekdays unchecked. add description/tooltip saying - "Now no sites will be blocked on Saturday or Sunday"?]
3. Choose how much distraction time you'd like per day.
   <small style="display: block;">Doing this means that site blocking only occurs when you're distraction time is up. By default, we've set it to 15mins a day, but you can change that if you'd like (maximum of 60mins).</small>

### Some specifics to know

- These settings can be changed at anytime, but will only take effect at 12am the next day.
- Websites listed as distracting in your Dayboard extension settings will display different color icons depending on how much distraction time you have left.
   - Yellow: Over 5mins left.
   - Orange: 5mins or less left.
   - Red: No time left. All distracting sites will be blocked for the rest of the day.
- Clicking on the Dayboard browser icon will give you more information about what's going on.
